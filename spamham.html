							<p>The problem presented is to order groups of wizards (35 wizards or 50 wizards) based on their age. The only information given to you is a list of constraints. Each constraint is in the form [A B C], which corresponds to ONLY wizard C not being in between wizard A and wizard B in age. The number of wizards that need to be ordered is the number of constraints that you are given. <br />I used a variation of the 3-SAT algorithm in which the constraints that were given were then converted into boolean expressions. However, using this alone caused the algorithm to fall into local minima. Local minima were dealt with by using the 3-Change technique. Memory of the best previous orderings and their scores were implemented as to have a "best-last" ordering to revert to in the case of a 3-Change resulting in and sustaining a poor order-score.</p>
