										<h2>Paya Labs</h2>
										<p>June 2017-August 2017</p>
									</header>
									<p>At Paya Labs I was tasked with beginning the development of a mobile-based iOS application. The software was an online learning platform for classical Indian music in order to facilitate teaching, even when the student and teacher may be interacting remotely. To develop the application I used React-Native and tested it on my own iOS device using expo. I gained valuable experience with not only React-Native but also many of the libraries and components commonly used in React-Native.<br /><br /> Supervisor/Mentor: Ramnivas Laddad<br /> Email: ramnivas@payalabs.com</p>

										<h2>Walmart Labs</h2>
										<p>June 2016-August 2016</p>
									</header>
									<p>At Walmart Labs, my internship project was to create a dashboard for the executive team. The executive team wanted the dashboard to provide a quick and concise overview of company services and health. The dashboard included information on the latency of major company services, database health, major upcoming updates, and also any P1 alerts and their status. The dashboard was created using React.js and Node.js. React.js was used for the front-end and much of the back-end development. Node.js was primarily used for database communication. Bootstrap and Highscharts were also used frequently throughout.<br /><br /> Supervisor/Mentor: Sam Varghese<br /> Email: svarghese@walmartlabs.com<br />Evaluation can be found on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsatoor12/">LinkedIn Profile</a>.</p>
