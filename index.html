						<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic08.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Rishi Satoor. I am a Bay Area native from Danville, CA. I am currently attending the University of California, Berkeley completing my final semester. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I began Berkeley insterested in Medicine on a Pre-Med tract; however, switched to Computer Science at the beginning of my Sophomore year. After completing some Upper Division Computer Science courses, I added Applied Mathematics at the end of my junior year in order to aid and further my undestanding of the Data Science related coursework. Between my internships and the rigorous material covered in both my math and computer ccience classes, I have been able to learn new material quickly and thoroughly.<br /> During my time at Berkeley I have become proficient in both Python and Java having taken numerous courses that have used both. I have done front-end work using Android Studio and also React Native for iOS applications. I also have experience using Python Notebooks and Jupyter along with many of the commonly used libraries on this platform. Moving forward I am looking to not only complement and apply my school work but also apply my knowledge to new and exciting technology that helps and benefits people around the world.</p>
