						<p class="indent"><span class="image left"><img src="images/xmaspic.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Rishi Satoor. I am a Bay Area native, born and raised in Danville, CA. Growing up, my life revolved around sports and winning my high school’s first Men’s Basketball State Championship was a great culmination of the years spent training and practicing. Between the time spent at the doctor’s offices of relatives in India and accompanying my mom and dad to work, I gained exposure to both medicine and tech. Between my fascination with the intricacy of the human body and desire to be able to help people truly feel better, I arrived at the University of California, Berkeley an eager pre-med student.<br />Upon completing my first year at Berkeley as well as my first computer science course, I decided to change my path from biology to computer science. The critical thinking and logic involved in computer science coursework was both appealing and rewarding. At the end of my junior year, I had completed courses in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. While AI did use statistics and math, the depth of the linear algebra and math in ML drove me to look into the possibility of majoring in Applied Mathematics with either a Computer Science concentration or minor. However, as I did some research, albeit my remaining semesters would be grueling, I realized I could major in both, which is what I ultimately chose to do. The rigorous material covered in the math and computer science classes has truly abetted my ability to learn new material quickly and thoroughly.<br />As I finish my final semester at Berkeley, I look forward to not only applying what I have learned in school, but also increasing my knowledge by learning more everyday. While my path may have changed, I still have the lasting desire to help people. I hope to be able to contribute to cutting-edge technology that will accomplish just that and touch the lives of many.
